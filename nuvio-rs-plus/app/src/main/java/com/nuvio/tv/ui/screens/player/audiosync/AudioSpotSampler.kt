/**
 * Reads a few short stretches of a film's audio far from the playhead, over its own connection, so
 * sync has evidence from across the film within seconds instead of only what playback has reached.
 *
 * The audio itself is delivered by the extractors factories (wrapped with an audio tap) while this
 * class only seeks and advances. Each worker reads spots over its own connection, so far-apart
 * spots arrive together where the host and playback allow more than one (see [run]). Containers interleave audio with video, so each spot costs its share of
 * the whole stream: a spot stops at its share of [targetBytes]. On a high-bitrate file that share
 * can hold only a few seconds, too little for whole sentences, so a spot keeps reading until it has
 * [minSpotMs] of audio when the connection is clearly faster than the stream (playback keeps its
 * bandwidth), never past [maxBytes] in total. Blocking; run it on a background thread.
