/**
 * The time window of a single seek-preview cue, expressed in the **playback** timebase.
 *
 * Seekr sprite sheets hold one frame per cue (a ~10 second grid today), so a preview
 * thumbnail never represents an exact millisecond — it represents the whole window
 * [startMs]..[endMs]. Resolving that window and keeping it in player state is what lets the
 * scrubber move in whole cues instead of promising a precision the sprite sheet cannot back
 * up.
 *
 * The cue times reported by the SDK are on the *preview* timeline; callers must subtract the
 * active sync offset before constructing this so both ends are directly comparable with
 * playback positions.

     * A cue's frame is captured at its *start*, so the containing cue is not the closest one
     * for positions in the back half of the window: at 18:29 the cue covering 18:20..18:30
     * holds an 18:20 frame, nine seconds stale, while the next cue's 18:30 frame is one second
     * away. Preferring the nearer frame roughly halves the worst-case error and, since the
     * playhead sits between the two, keeps the filmstrip reading symmetrically around it.
     *
     * The window is therefore shifted back by half a cue, but its trailing edge is left at
     * [endMs] rather than pulled in: the last cue of a track has no successor to hand over to,
     * so it has to keep representing the run-out to the end of the media.
     *
     * This approximates the hand-over using *this* cue's length, where [prefersSuccessorFor]
     * decides it exactly using the preceding cue's midpoint. The two agree whenever
     * neighbouring cues are the same length, which is every cue on today's uniform 10s grid.
     * Once the generator writes real keyframe times as cue starts, cue lengths will vary and
     * the two will disagree near a length change — harmlessly, since a cue that fails this
     * check merely falls back to free stepping, but this is the place to revisit if grid
     * locking is to stay exact on a non-uniform grid.

/**
 * Grid-locked scrubbing: turns a free-form seek delta into a move of whole preview cues.
 *
 * ### Why
 * The scrubber can address every millisecond, but previews exist only once per cue. Scrubbing
 * freely therefore lands the user on positions that no thumbnail describes, and the frame they
 * were shown can be several seconds away from where they end up — worst of all across a shot
 * boundary, where "a few seconds out" reads as "the wrong scene". Rather than approximating
 * the missing frames, this narrows the claim: every position the user can stop on is a
 * position we hold a real frame for, so preview and playback always agree.
 *
 * ### How
 * The cue window resolved for the frame currently on screen (see [SeekPreviewCue]) is the only
 * input needed — no global cue table, which the SDK does not expose. Stepping forward one cue
 * is "seek to this cue's end", which is exactly the next cue's start; larger steps extrapolate
 * from the cue's own length. Extrapolation only ever picks the *candidate* position: once the
 * thumbnail for it resolves, the true cue start comes back and [alignedTargetMs] snaps the
 * pending position onto it, so a non-uniform cue grid self-corrects within one frame and can
 * never drift or stall.

     * 18:20, rather than nudging a single second onto the frame already on screen.
     *
     * Falls back to plain [fromMs] + [deltaMs] whenever grid-locking cannot be justified —
     * no cue resolved yet, a degenerate cue, or a cue that does not describe [fromMs]
